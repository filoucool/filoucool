### Greetings,

### About me:
  <p>I think like a programmer but act like a hacker (ethical, Right? Right...?)  
  I have the soul of a programmer, the heart of an engineer but the blood of a business man. 
  Confused yet? Me too </p>
  
 ### What am I doing of my life?
 <p>
  -I'm learning the physical basics of Quantum Computing.
 </p>
  

### Things that dont matter

- 11% of Americans think "HTML" is a disease which means 89% of Americans are wrong. <br>
- Flowers grow faster in a viagra solution. <br>
-If you farted for 6 years and 9 months, you would've produced enough gas to create the energy of an atomic bomb. <br>
</p>

### What am I actually working on?
<p>
  <ol>
<li> A huge autonomous robot to plow my driveway because I'm a lazy fuck. </li>
<li> A ridiculously advanced walking Keurig coffee pod (I wish I was joking) </li>
