### Greetings,

### About me:
  <p>I think like a programmer but act like a hacker (ethical, Right? Right...?)  
  I have the soul of a programmer, the heart of an engineer but the blood of a business man. 
        Confused yet? Me too </p>

### Things that dont really matter
- I’m currently working on too many things. smh
- I’m currently learning the physical basics of Quantum Computing.
- I’m looking to collaborate on a major robot to take over the world.
- Ask me about whatever you want. 
- Stupid fact: You're twice as likely to be killed by a fucking vending machine than a shark. Think about that. #SharkWeek

### What am I actually working on?
<p>-A huge autonomous robot to plow my driveway because I'm a lazy fuck. <br>
-A walking Keurig coffee pod (I wish I was joking tbh) <br>
-Bringing back to life a PC-BOT 914... <br>
-I might be starting a 4th business? IDK... too early to tell...
-</p>
