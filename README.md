### Greetings,

### About me:
  <p>I think like a programmer but act like a hacker (ethical, Right? Right...?)  
  I have the soul of a programmer, the heart of an engineer but the blood of a business man. 
  Confused yet? Me too </p>
  <br>

 ### What am I doing of my life?
 <p>
  -I'm learning the physical basics of Quantum Computing.
 </p>
  

### Things that dont matter
<p>
- Stupid fact: You're twice as likely to be killed by a fucking vending machine than a shark. Think about that. #SharkWeek
</p>

### What am I actually working on?
<p>
-A huge autonomous robot to plow my driveway because I'm a lazy fuck. <br>
-A ridiculously advanced walking Keurig coffee pod (I wish I was joking) <br>
-Bringing back to life a PC-BOT 914... <br>
-I might be starting a 4th business? IDK... too early to tell... <br>
-Buying a house. Why not right? <br>
