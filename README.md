### Greetings,

### About me:
  <p>I think like a programmer but act like a hacker (ethical, Right? Right...?)  
  I have the soul of a programmer, the heart of an engineer but the blood of a business man. 
  Confused yet? Me too </p>
  
 ### What am I doing of my life?
 <p>
  -I'm learning the physical basics of Quantum Computing.
 </p>
  

### Facts that actually matter
<p>
- You're twice as likely to be killed by a fucking vending machine than a shark. Think about that. #SharkWeek <br>
- Walmart has a lower acceptance rate than Harvard. <br>
- hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words. <br>
- 11% of Americans think "HTML" is a disease which means 89% of Americans are wrong. <br>
- Flowers grow faster in a viagra solution. <br>
- If you farted for 6 years and 9 months, you would produce as much energy as an atomic bomb. <br>
</p>
