### Greetings,

###About me:
  I think like a programmer but act like a hacker (ethical, Right? Right...?)  
  I have the soul of a programmer, the heart of an engineer but the blood of a business man. 
        Confused yet? Me too

###Things that dont really matter
- I’m currently working on too many things. smh
- I’m currently learning the physical basics of Quantum Computing.
- I’m looking to collaborate on a major robot to take over the world.
- Ask me about whatever you want. 
- Stupid fact: You're twice as likely to be killed by a fucking vending machine than a shark. Think about that. #SharkWeek
